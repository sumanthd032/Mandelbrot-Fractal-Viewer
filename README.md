# Mandelbrot Fractal Generator with NumPy and Matplotlib

## Overview

This project generates and visualizes the **Mandelbrot fractal**, a famous and infinitely complex mathematical set, using **Python**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**.

You can interactively explore the fractal by changing parameters such as resolution, iteration depth, and the region of the complex plane.

## Features

* **Efficient Mandelbrot set computation** using NumPy vectorization.
* **Visualization of the fractal** with Matplotlib's color maps.
* **Interactive exploration** using sliders (`ipywidgets`) to zoom and adjust iterations.
* **Well-documented code** suitable for learning and portfolio use.

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sumanthd032/mandelbrot-fractal-viewer.git
    cd mandelbrot-fractal-numpy
    ```

2.  **Install required packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install numpy matplotlib ipywidgets
    ```

3.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

4.  **Open `mandelbrot_fractal.ipynb`** and run all cells.

## Additional Notes

* For the best interactive experience, ensure `ipywidgets` is installed and enabled in your Jupyter environment.
* If sliders donâ€™t work locally, try running the notebook on Google Colab.
* The fractal can be explored by adjusting zoom parameters and iteration counts to reveal intricate details.
